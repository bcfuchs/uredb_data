##Place adjectives

*place_adjectives.csv* maps adjectives for ancient Greco-Roman places to their place names. 

Data was compiled from three sources: 
* Uredb -- The Ure Museum database
* Wikipedia -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adjectival_and_demonymic_forms_of_place_names#Regions_in_Greco-Roman_antiquity]
* A dump of place adjectives provided by the Perseus Project

After compilation, the data was edited by hand to fix broken entries and remove irrelevant ones.

Scripts and data used to produce the file can be found here in *make_adjective_place.sh*: [https://github.com/bcfuchs/uredb_rdf_tools/tree/master/pelagios]

Please note: the list is not complete!
